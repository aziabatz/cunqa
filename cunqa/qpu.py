"""
    Contains the description of the :py:class:`~cunqa.qpu.QPU` class.

    These :py:class:`QPU` objects are the python representation of the virtual QPUs deployed.
    Each one has its :py:class:`QClient` object that communicates with the server of the corresponding virtual QPU.
    Through these objects we are able to send circuits and recieve results from simulations.

    Virtual QPUs
    ============
    Each virtual QPU is described by three elements:

        - **Server**: classical resources intended to communicate with the python API to recieve circuits or quantum tasks and to send results of the simulations.
        - **Backend**: characteristics that define the QPU that is emulated: coupling map, basis gates, noise model, etc.
        - **Simulator**: classical resources intended to simulate circuits accordingly to the backend characteristics.

    In order to stablish communication with the server, in the python API :py:class:`QPU` objects are created, each one of them associated with a virtual QPU.
    Each object will have a :py:class:`QClient` C++ object through which the communication with the classical resoruces is performed.

    Connecting to virtual QPUs
    ==========================

    The submodule :py:mod:`~cunqa.qutils` gathers functions for obtaining information about the virtual QPUs available;
    among them, the :py:func:`~cunqa.qutils.get_QPUs` function returns a list of :py:class:`QPU` objects with the desired filtering:

    >>> from cunqa import get_QPUs
    >>> get_QPUs()
    [<cunqa.qpu.QPU object at XXXX>, <cunqa.qpu.QPU object at XXXX>, <cunqa.qpu.QPU object at XXXX>]

    When each :py:class:`QPU` is instanciated, the corresponding :py:class:`QClient` is created.
    Nevertheless, it is not until the first job is submited that the client actually connects to the correspoding server.
    Other properties and information gathered in the :py:class:`QPU` class are shown on its documentation.

    Interacting with virtual QPUs
    =============================

    Once we have the :py:class:`QPU` objects created, we can start interacting with them.
    The most important method of the class is :py:meth:`QPU.run`, which allows to send a circuit to the virtual QPU for its simulation,
    returning a :py:class:`~cunqa.qjob.QJob` object associated to the quantum task:

        >>> qpus = get_QPUs()
        >>> qpu = qpus[0]
        >>> qpu.run(circuit)
        <cunqa.qjob.QJob object at XXXX>

    This method takes several arguments for specifications of the simulation such as `shots` or `transpilation`.
    For a larger description of its functionalities checkout its documentation.
