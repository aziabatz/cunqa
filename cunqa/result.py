class Result:

    Class to describe the result of a simulation.

    It has two main attributes:

    - :py:attr:`Result.counts` : returns the distribution of counts from the sampling of the simulation.

            >>> result.counts
            {'000':34, '111':66}

    .. note::
        If the circuit sent has more than one classical register, bit strings corresponding to each one of them will be separated
        by blank spaces in the order they were added:

            >>> result.counts
            {'001 11':23, '110 10':77}

            0.056

    Nevertheless, depending on the simulator used, more output data is provided. For checking all the information from the simulation as a ``dict``, one can
    access the attribute :py:attr:`Result.result`.

    If an error occurs at the simulation, an exception will be raised at the pyhton program, :py:exc:`ResultError`.
