"""
    Contains objects that define and manage quantum emulation jobs. The core of this module is the 
    class :py:class:`~cunqa.qjob.QJob`. These objects are created when a quantum job is sent to a 
    vQPU, as a return of the :py:func:`~cunqa.qpu.run` function:

        >>> run(circuit, qpu)
        <cunqa.qjob.QJob object at XXXXXXXX>
        
    In this method, after the :py:class:`~cunqa.qjob.QJob` instance is created, the circuit is 
    submitted for simulation at the vQPU. :py:class:`QJob` is the bridge between sending a 
    circuit with instructions and receiving the results.

    Another functionality described in the submodule is the function :py:func:`~cunqa.qjob.gather`, 
    which receives a list of :py:class:`~QJob` objects and returns their results as 
    :py:class:`~cunqa.result.Result` objects.

        >>> qjob_1 = run(circuit_1, qpu_1)
        >>> qjob_2 = run(circuit_2, qpu_2)
        >>> gather([qjob_1, qjob_2])
        [<cunqa.result.Result object at XXXXXXXX>, <cunqa.result.Result object at XXXXXXXX>]

class QJob:
    """
    Class to handle jobs sent to vQPUs. A :py:class:`QJob` object is created as the output 
    of the :py:meth:`~cunqa.qpu.run` method. The quantum job not only contains the circuit to 
    be simulated, but also simulation instructions and information of the vQPU to which the job 
    is sent. This class has a main attribute: :py:attr:`QJob.result` which stores the information 
    about the execution. 

    .. autoattribute:: result

    But first, in order to be able to call the attribute :py:attr:`QJob.result`, it is necessary to 
    submit the job for execution. To do so, we will use the method :py:meth:`QJob.submit`.

    .. automethod:: submit

    But the objective of the :py:class:`QJob` class is not only to retrieve the result. It also 
    allows an easy updating of the quantum task sent without the need of resend the whole circuit. 
    This is really useful, especially working with variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) [#]_, which 
    need to change the parameters of the gates in a circuit as they are optimized in each iteration. 
    This parameter update is done using the :py:meth:`~QJob.upgrade_parameters` method.

    .. automethod:: upgrade_parameters
