"""
    Contains objects that define and manage quantum emulation jobs.

    The core of this module is the class :py:class:`~cunqa.qjob.QJob`. These objects are created when a quantum job
    is sent to a virtual QPU, as a return of the :py:meth:`~cunqa.qpu.QPU.run` method:

        >>> qpu.run(circuit)
        <cunqa.qjob.QJob object at XXXXXXXX>
        
    Once it is created, the circuit is being simulated at the virtual QPU.
    :py:class:`QJob` is the bridge between sending a circuit with instructions and recieving the results.
    Because of this, usually one wants to save this output in a variable:

        >>> qjob = qpu.run(circuit)

    Another functionality described in the submodule is the function :py:func:`~gather`, 
    which recieves a list of :py:class:`~QJob` objects and returns their results as :py:class:`~cunqa.result.Result`
    objects.

        >>> qjob_1 = qpu_1.run(circuit_1)
        >>> qjob_2 = qpu_2.run(circuit_2)
        >>> results = gather([qjob_1, qjob_2])

    """
    Class to handle jobs sent to virtual QPUs.

    A :py:class:`QJob` object is created as the output of the :py:meth:`~cunqa.qpu.QPU.run` method.
    The quantum job not only contains the circuit to be simulated, but also simulation instructions and information of the virtual QPU to which the job is sent.

    One would want to save the :py:class:`QJob` resulting from sending a circuit in a variable.
    Let's say we want to send a circuit to a QPU and get the result and the time taken for the simulation:

        >>> qjob = qpu.run(circuit)
        >>> result = qjob.result
        >>> print(result)
        <cunqa.result.Result object at XXXXXXXX>
        >>> time_taken = qjob.time_taken
        >>> print(time_taken)
        0.876

    Note that the `time_taken` is expressed in seconds. More instructions on obtaining data from :py:class:`~cunqa.result.Result`
    objects can be found on its documentation.

    Handling QJobs sent to the same QPU
    ====================================
    Let's say we are sending two different jobs to the same QPU.
    This would not result on a parallelization, each QPU can only execute one simulation at the time.
    When a virtual QPU recieves a job while simulating one, it would wait in line untill the earlier finishes.
    Because of how the client-server comunication is built, we must be careful and call for the results in the same order in which the jobs where submited.
    The correct workflow would be:

        >>> qjob_1 = qpu.run(circuit_1)
        >>> qjob_2 = qpu.run(circuit_2)
        >>> result_1 = qjob_1.result
        >>> result_2 = qjob_2.result

    This is because the server follows the rule FIFO (*First in first out*), if we want to recieve the second result,
    the first one has to be out.

    .. warning::
        In the case in which the order is not respected, everything would work, but results will not correspond
        to the job. A mix up would happen.

    Handling QJobs sent to different QPUs
    =====================================
    Here we can have parallelization since we are working with more than one virtual QPU.
    Let's send two circuits to two different QPUs:

        >>> qjob_1 = qpu_1.run(circuit_1)
        >>> qjob_2 = qpu_2.run(circuit_2)
        >>> result_1 = qjob_1.result
        >>> result_2 = qjob_2.result

    This way, when we send the first job, then inmediatly the sencond one is sent, because :py:meth:`~cunqa.qpu.QPU.run` does not wait
    for the simulation to finish. In this manner, both jobs are being run in both QPUs simultaneously! Here we do not need to perserve the order,
    since jobs are managed by different :py:class:`QClient` objects, there can be no mix up.

    In fact, the function :py:func:`~cunqa.qjob.gather` is designed for recieving a list of qjobs and return the results; therefore, let's say
    we have a list of circuits that we want to submit to a group of QPUs:

        >>> qjobs = []
        >>> for circuit, qpu in zip(circuits, qpus):
        >>> ... qjob = qpu.run(circuit)
        >>> ... qjobs.append(qjob)
        >>> results = gather(qjobs)

    In this workflow, all circuits are sent to each QPU an simulated at the same time. Then, when calling for the results, the program is blocked
    waiting for all of them to finish. Other examples of classical parallelization of quantum simulation taks can be found at the
    `Examples Gellery <https://cesga-quantum-spain.github.io/cunqa/examples_gallery.html>`_.

    .. note::
        The function :py:func:`~cunqa.qjob.gather` can also handle :py:class:`~QJob` objects sent to the same virtual QPU, but the order must
        be perserved in the list provided.


    Upgrading parameters from QJobs
    ===============================

    In some ocassion, especially working with variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) [#]_, they need of changing the parameters of the gates in a circuit
    arises. These parameters are optimzied in order to get the circuit to output a result that minimizes a problem. In this minimization process,
    parameters are updated on each iteration (in general).
    
    Our first thought can be to update the parameters, build a new circuit with them and send
    it to the QPU. Nevertheless, since the next circuit will have the same data but for the value of the parameters in the gates, a lot of information
    is repeated, so :py:mod:`~cunqa` has a more efficient and simple way to handle this cases: a method to send to the QPU a list with the new parameters
    to be assigned to the circuit, :py:meth:`~QJob.upgrade_parameters`.

    Let's see a simple example: creating a parametric circuit and uptading its parameters:

        >>> # building the parametric circuit
        >>> circuit = CunqaCircuit(3)
        >>> circuit.ry(0.25, 0)
        >>> circuit.rx(0.5, 1)
        >>> circuit.p(0.98, 2)
        >>> circuit.measure_all()
        >>> # sending the circuit to a virtual QPU
        >>> qjob = qpu.run(circuit)
        >>> # defining the new set of parameters
        >>> new_parameters = [1,1,0]
        >>> # upgrading the parameters of the job
        >>> qjob.upgrade_parameters(new_parameters)
        >>> result = qjob.result

    From this simple workflow, we can build loops that update parameters according to some rules, or by a optimizator, and upgrade the circuit until
    some stoping criteria is fulfilled.

    .. warning::
        Before sending the circuit or upgrading its parameters, the result of the prior job must be called. It can be done manually, so that we can
        save it and obtain its information, or it can be done automatically as in the example above, but be aware that once the :py:meth:`upgrade_parameters`
        method is called, this result is discarded.
