    Holds CUNQA's custom circuit class and functions to translate its instructions into other formats for circuit definition.

    Building circuits
    =================

    Users can define a circuit using :py:class:`~CunqaCircuit` to then send it to the virtual QPUs.
    Nevertheless, for the case in which no communications are needed among the circuits sent,  :py:class:`qiskit.QuantumCircuit` [#]_ is also allowed.
    Be aware that some instructions might not be supported for :py:class:`~CunqaCircuit`, for the list of supported instructions check its documentation.
    Module py:mod:`cunqa.converters` contains functions to transform between circuit formats.

    Circuits by json ``dict`` format
    ================================

    A low level way of representing a circuit is by a json ``dict`` with specefic fields that gather the information
    needed by the simulator in order to run the circuit.

    This structe is presented below:

    .. code-block:: python

       {"id":str, # circuit identificator
        "is_parametric":bool, # weather if the circuit has parametric instructions that can be updated
        "is_dynamic":bool, # weather if the circuit has intermediate measurements or conditioned operations
        "instructions":list[dict], # list of instructions of the circuit in dict format
        "num_qubits":int, # number of qubits of the circuit
        "num_clbits":int, # number of classical bits of the circuit
        "quantum_registers":dict, # dict specifying the grouping of the qubits in registers
        "classical_registers":dict # dict specifying the grouping of the classical bits in registers
        }

    On the other hand, instructions have some mandatory and optional keys:

    .. code-block:: python

        {"name":str, # MANDATORY, name of the instruction, has to be accepted by the simulator
         "qubits":list[int], # MANDATORY, qubits on which the instruction acts
         "params":list[int|float] | list[list[[int|float]]], # OPTIONAL, only required for parametric gates and for \'unitary\' instruction.
         "clbits":list[int], # OPTINAL, any classical bits used in the instruction
        }

    For classical and quantum communications among circuits, we do not recomend working at such low level format, users rather
    describe this operations through the :py:class:`~cunqa.circuit.CunqaCircuit` class. If curious, you can always
    create the :py:class:`~cunqa.circuit.CunqaCircuit` and obtain its intructions by its attribute :py:attr:`~cunqa.circuit.CunqaCircuit.instructions`,
    or you can convert it to the json `dict` format by the :py:func:`~cunqa.converters.convert` function.

    Class to define a quantum circuit for the :py:mod:`~cunqa` api.

    This class serves as a tool for the user to describe not only simple circuits, but also to describe classical and quantum operations between circuits.
    On its initialization, it takes as mandatory the number of qubits for the circuit *num_qubits*), also number of classical bits (*num_clbits*) and a personalized id (*id*), which by default would be randomly generated.
    Once the object is created, class methods canbe used to add instructions to the circuit such as single-qubit and two-qubits gates, measurements, conditional operations,... but also operations that allow to send measurement outcomes or qubits to other circuits.
    This sending operations require that the virtual QPUs to which the circuits are sent support classical or quantum communications with the desired connectivity.

    Creating your first CunqaCircuit
    ---------------------------------

    Start by instantiating the class providing the desired number of qubits:

        >>> circuit = CunqaCircuit(2)

    Then, gates can be added through the mentioned methods. Let's add a Hadamard gate and CNOT gates to create a Bell state:

        >>> circuit.h(0) # adding hadamard to qubit 0
        >>> circuit.cx(0,1)

    Finally, qubits are measured by:

        >>> circuit.measure_all()

    Once the circuit is ready, it is ready to be sent to a QPU by the method :py:meth:`~cunqa.qpu.QPU.run`.

    Other methods to manupulate the class are:

    .. list-table::
       :header-rows: 1
       :widths: 20 80

       * - Method
         - 
       * - :py:meth:`~CunqaCircuit.from_instructions`
         - Class method to add operations to the circuit from a list of dict-type instructions.
       * - :py:meth:`~CunqaCircuit.assign_parameters`
         - Plugs values into the intructions of parametric gates marked with a parameter name.
    

    Classical communications among circuits
    ---------------------------------------

    The strong part of :py:class:`CunqaCircuit` is that it allows to define communication directives between circuits.
    We can define the sending of a classical bit from one circuit to another by:

        >>> circuit_1 = CunqaCircuit(2)
        >>> circuit_2 = CunqaCircuit(2)
        >>> circuit_1.h(0)
        >>> circuit_1.measure_and_send(0, circuit_2) # qubit 0 is measured and the outcome is sent to circuit_2
        >>> circuit_2.remote_c_if("x", 0, circuit_1) # the outcome is recived to perform a classicaly controlled operation
        >>> circuit_1.measure_all()
        >>> circuit_2.measure_all()

    Then, circuits can be sent to QPUs that support classical communications using the :py:meth:`~cunqa.mappers.run_distributed` function.

    Circuits can also be referend to through their *id* string. When a CunqaCircuit is created, by default a random *id* is assigned, but it can also be personalized:

        >>> circuit_1 = CunqaCircuit(2, id = "1")
        >>> circuit_2 = CunqaCircuit(2, id = "2")
        >>> circuit_1.h(0)
        >>> circuit_1.measure_and_send(0, "2") # qubit 0 is measured and the outcome is sent to circuit_2
        >>> circuit_2.remote_c_if("x", 0, "1") # the outcome is recived to perform a classicaly controlled operation
        >>> circuit_1.measure_all()
        >>> circuit_2.measure_all()

    Teledata protocol
    -----------------
    .. image:: /_static/teledata.png
        :align: center
        :width: 150
        :height: 300px

    The teledata protocol consists on the reconstruction of an unknown quantum state of a given physical system at a different location without actually transmitting the system [#]_.
    Within :py:mod:`cunqa`, when quantum communications among the virtual QPUs utilized are available, a qubit from one circuit can be sent to another, the teledata protocol is implemented
    at a lower level so there is no need for the user to implement it.
    In this scheme, generally an acilla qubit would be neccesary to recieve the quantum state. Let's see an example for the creation of a Bell pair remotely:

        >>> circuit_1 = CunqaCircuit(2, 1, id = "1")
        >>> circuit_2 = CunqaCircuit(2, 2, id = "2")
        >>>
        >>> circuit_1.h(0); circuit_1.cx(0,1)
        >>> circuit_1.qsend(1, "1") # sending qubit 1 to circuit with id "2"
        >>> circuit_1.measure(0,0)
        >>>
        >>> circuit_2.qrecv(0, "2") # reciving qubit from circuit with id "1" and assigning it to qubit 0
        >>> circuit_2.cx(0,1)
        >>> circuit_2.measure_all()

    It is important to note that the qubit used for the communication, the one send, after the operation it is reset, so in a general basis it wouldn't need to be measured.
    If we want to send more qubits afer, we can use it since it is reset to zero.

    Telegate protocol
    -----------------
    .. image:: /_static/telegate.png
        :align: center
        :width: 150
        :height: 300px

    Quantum gate teleportation, also known as telegate, reduces the topological requirements by substituting two-qubit gates with other cost-effective resources: auxiliary entangled states, local
    measurements, and single-qubit operations [#]_. This is another feature available in :py:mod:`cunqa` in the quantum communications scheme, managed by the :py:class:`~cunqa.circuit.ControlContext` class.
    Here is an example analogous to the one presented above:

        >>> circuit_1 = CunqaCircuit(2, id = "1")
        >>> circuit_2 = CunqaCircuit(1, id = "2")
        >>>
        >>> circuit_1.h(0); circuit_1.cx(0,1)
        >>>
        >>> with circuit_1.expose(1, circuit_2) as rcontrol: # exposing qubit at circuit_1
        >>>     circuit_2.cx(rcontol, 1) # applying telegate operation controlled by the exposed qubit
        >>>
        >>> circuit_1.measure_all()
        >>> circuit_2.measure_all()

    Here there is no need for an ancilla since the control is the exposed qubit from the other circuit/virtual QPU.

    .. warning::
        Note that the circuit specification in :py:meth:`CunqaCircuit.expose` cannot be done by passing the circuit :py:attr:`CunqaCircuit.id` since the
        :py:class:`~cunqa.circuit.ControlContext` object needs the :py:class:`CunqaCircuit` object in order to manage the telegate block.
