    Embarrasingly parallel scheme

As it was introduced, this scheme consists in the **classical offloading of quantum tasks** by mapping 
circuits to the available QPUs. For this, there is no need of inter-QPU communications of any type.

This distribution is convenient for **exploiting resources** and for **accelerating execution times** by reducing
workload for each quantum node.

**How to deploy**
-----------------
Within CUNQA, an insfrastructure of vQPUs which do not incorporate communications among them is 
launched as follows. Note that the number of vQPUs and their maximum deployment time are the only 
mandatory flags, for other additional options checkout :doc:`../reference/commands/qraise`. 

.. tab:: Bash command

    .. code-block:: bash

        qraise -n 4 -t 01:00:00 <max time> [OTHER]

.. tab:: Python function

    .. code-block:: python

        family = qraise(4, <max time>, [OTHER])

An useful feature is the ``--family`` flag (and ``family`` attribute in Python), since it allows us to tag the set of vQPUs. If 
none is entered, family name will be the *SLURM job id* of the process in which the vQPUs live, 
shown right after they are lauched in the terminal or returned as a ``str`` by the Python function. 
It is also recomended to use the ``--co-located`` flag (and ``co_located`` attribute in Python), as 
it allows to access the vQPUs from every node, not just the one the vQPUs are being set up. In this 
documentation we are going to consider that this flag is set.

**Circuits design**
----------------------
For instanciating :py:class:`~cunqa.circuit.core.CunqaCircuit` class we must provide the number of qubits
and, if single-qubit measurements are intended to be done, number of classical bits

.. code-block:: python

    cunqacircuit = CunqaCirucit(num_qubits=2, num_clbits=2)

For quantum tasks ran in this scheme the limitation is that communications directives are not 
allowed since their are not available for the vQPUs. Supported instructions, not only for this 
scheme, are further explained at :py:class:`~cunqa.circuit.core.CunqaCircuit`.

**Execution**
--------------
Once we obtain the :py:class:`~cunqa.qpu.QPU` objects through :py:func:`~cunqa.qpu.get_QPUs` 
function :py:func:`~cunqa.qpu.run` is employed for executing them into the vQPUs. By providing
the list of circuits and the list of :py:class:`~cunqa.qpu.QPU` objects we allow their mapping.

.. code-block:: python 

    qpus_list = get_QPUs(family=family, co_located=True)

    qjobs = run(circuits_list, qpus_list, shots=1024)

The output is a list of :py:class:`~cunqa.qjob.QJob` objects, each one associated to each quantum 
task. One can also input a single circuit instead of a list and it will be mapped to all vQPUs 
provided. Executions results can be obtained all together by the :py:func:`~cunqa.qjob.gather` 
function.

.. code-block:: python

    results = gather(qjobs)

This call for the results is a blocking call, since all simulations running in parallel need to be 
done for the :py:class:`~cunqa.result.Result` objects to be returned. To access information such as 
time of simulation or output statistics there are class attributes, such as the shown below.

.. code-block:: python

    times_list  = [result.time_taken for result in results]
    counts_list = [result.counts for result in results]


**Basic example**
------------------
Next, we show an example that contains all the steps for an embarrasingly parallel distribution. 
Further examples and use cases are listed in :doc:`../further_examples/further_examples`.


.. code-block:: python

    import os, sys
    # In order to import cunqa, we append to the search path the cunqa installation path.
    # In CESGA, we install by default on the $HOME path as $HOME/bin is in the PATH variable
    sys.path.append(os.getenv("HOME"))

    from cunqa.qpu import get_QPUs, qraise, qdrop, run
    from cunqa.circuit import CunqaCircuit
    from cunqa.qjob import gather

    # 1. QPU deployment

    family_name = qraise(2, "01:00:00", family_name = "qpu_no_comms")
    qpus = get_QPUs(family = family_name)


    # 2. Circuit design

    cunqacircuit = CunqaCircuit(num_qubits = 2, num_clbits = 2)

    cunqacircuit.h(0)
    cunqacircuit.cx(0,1)

    cunqacircuit.measure_all()

    # 3. Execution

    qjobs = run(cunqacircuit, qpus, shots = 100)
    results = gather(qjobs)
    counts_list = [result.counts for result in results]

    for counts, qpu in zip(counts_list, qpus):

        print(f"Counts from vQPU {qpu.id}: {counts}")

    # 4. Release classical resources
    qdrop(family_name)
