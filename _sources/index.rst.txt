Welcome to CUNQA's documentation!
=================================

**CUNQA** is a Python/C++ platform to simulate distributed quantum computing on the `CESGA HPC environment <https://cesga-docs.gitlab.io/index.html>`_.

.. CUNQA creates and manages virtual QPUs, which are classical resources allocated for emulation tasks, where distributed quantum programs can be executed.
 The Python API is structured in a way which will be familiar to Qiskit users, while the backend is written in C++ for performance.
 All code available on our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/CESGA-Quantum-Spain/cunqa>`_. 

.. First time users can find an installation guide in :doc:`modulesetup`. Additionally, a tutorial to learn how to use **CUNQA** can be found in :doc:`first_steps`. 

.. For documentation of individual objects and functions check :doc:`cunqa`. Illustrative examples of use can be found in :doc:`examples_gallery`.
